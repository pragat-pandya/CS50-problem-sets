1)Checking whether specifically one command-line argument is provided or not.
2)if provided then we move on.
3)IF NOT we exit the program with exit code: 1, printing the error msg.

MOVING ON:
3)Checking whether the provided command-line argument is STRICTLY ALPHABATIC or NOT!
4)If yes then move to next step , IF NOT then go to step (3).
5)Write a function that provides the shifting key according to the entered keyword.
6)Prompting the user for plaintext.
7)Creating place holder for output ciphertext
8)Using the same code as of CAESAR's cipher just adding a if else statment to keep track of iterations over the no. of letters of keyword for iterating key.
9)If we go out of index of the keyword then start over again with the first letter of the keyword as the KEY.
10) Verifing the correct behaviour of the program.
